    <h1>Our mission</h1>
    </header>
<p> The company was founded with the intent of supplying 3D printed parts on a global scale. We are located in almost every continent with 800 3D printing farms and distribution plants total. Our business model is to stay up to date as much as we can in terms of technology and climate. As of recently, we have begun updating some of our facilities with the technology to recycle plastic waste to be used in your prints! We are committed to providing our patrons, employees and the Earth the best service anyone can ask for!</p>
